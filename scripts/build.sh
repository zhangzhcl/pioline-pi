# Pipline Local Build Script
#
# Builds Pipline artifacts on the local machine for internal QA. Does NOT
# touch git, does NOT bump versions, does NOT push tags, does NOT publish
# a release. Public release remains the job of:
#   - scripts/release.sh
#   - .github/workflows/release.yml
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/build.sh [platform]
#
# Platforms:
#   mac-arm      Apple Silicon DMG (aarch64-apple-darwin)
#   mac-intel    Intel Mac DMG, cross-compiled on Apple Silicon hosts
#   windows      Bare .exe + zip, cross-compiled via MinGW (no MSI)
#   current      Detect host OS + arch, dispatch to the matching builder
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - macOS host (or Linux for windows cross only)
#   - Rust via rustup (NOT Homebrew — Homebrew rust breaks cross-compile)
#   - Bun (project uses Bun only; never npm/pnpm)
#   - For windows: MinGW (`brew install mingw-w64`) and the
#     x86_64-pc-windows-gnu rustup target (auto-installed on first run)
#
# Scope:
#   - macOS: ad-hoc signed by default (signingIdentity: "-" in
#     tauri.conf.json). Gatekeeper will block the first launch;
#     right-click Open to bypass. Export APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY (plus
#     APPLE_ID/APPLE_PASSWORD/APPLE_TEAM_ID for notarization) to build with
#     a real Developer ID cert instead — Tauri picks these up directly.
#   - Windows: bare .exe + zip. No MSI (requires Windows host tools).

Pipline Local Build Script

Builds Picot artifacts on the local machine for internal QA. Does NOT
publish a release; use scripts/release.sh + GitHub Actions for that.

Usage:
  ./scripts/build.sh [platform]

Platforms:
  mac-arm      Apple Silicon DMG (aarch64-apple-darwin)
  mac-intel    Intel Mac DMG (x86_64-apple-darwin), cross-compiled
  mac-universal  Universal DMG (arm64 + x86_64 fat binary)
  windows      Bare .exe + zip, cross-compiled via MinGW (no MSI)
  current      Detect host OS/arch and dispatch (default)

Examples:
  ./scripts/build.sh mac-arm
  ./scripts/build.sh mac-universal
  ./scripts/build.sh windows

Notes:
  - macOS artifacts are ad-hoc signed. Gatekeeper will block first launch;
    right-click Open to bypass.
  - Windows cross-build requires MinGW: brew install mingw-w64
  - Final artifacts are copied to the repo root for easy distribution
    (e.g. Pipline_0.2.3_aarch64.dmg, Pipline_0.2.3_windows_x64.zip).
  - The script never touches git, never creates tags, never pushes.
